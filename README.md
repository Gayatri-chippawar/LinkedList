# 📌 Linked List Operations (From Scratch)
## 📖 Overview

This project is a Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice implementation of a Singly Linked List created completely from scratch.
The main goal is to understand pointer manipulation, node linking, and edge cases without using any built-in libraries.

## 🛠️ Implemented Operations

➕ addFirst – Insert a node at the beginning of the list

➕ addLast – Insert a node at the end of the list

➖ removeFirst – Delete the first node of the list

➖ removeLast – Delete the last node of the list

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand node structure and references

Practice head and tail management

Handle empty list and single-node list cases

Strengthen core DSA fundamentals for interviews

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

Singly Linked List

Nodes & Pointers

Time Complexity Analysis

Edge Case Handling

## ⚙️ Time Complexity
Operation	Time Complexity
addFirst	O(1)
addLast	O(1)
removeFirst	O(1)
removeLast	O(n)
## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

Compile and run the main file

Call the functions to test different linked list operations
